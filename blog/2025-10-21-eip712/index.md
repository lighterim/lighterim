The Imperative for Intent-Based Transactions
======

Decentralized trading fundamentally requires a counterparty. While on-chain transactions are now commonplace, securing a suitable trading counterparty quickly and efficiently remains a major challenge in the ecosystem.

It is a game-changer when a user can **delegate their trading intent** to a third party, and that delegate (or solver/relayer) is empowered to execute the transaction **faithfully** and **honestly** according to the user's expressed wishes. Furthermore, in scenarios involving fund commitment, assets no longer need to be idle or locked up before a viable counterparty is secured.

`EIP-712`-based `Uniswap Permit2` serves as this foundation of trust, acting as the honest guardian for signed intents, enabling widespread adoption and growth across the Ethereum and EVM-compatible ecosystems.

## Ensuring Intent Fulfillment

Unlike the traditional `ERC-20` `approve/allowance` mechanism, `Permit2` abstracts and enforces several critical parameters: **deadline, amount, spender, and Nonce**.

Every signed fund transfer must strictly adhere to these conditions. The unique **Nonce** is consumed upon first use, effectively eliminating replay attacks. Compared to the basic approve/allowance, this offers subtle, granular control over the authorized transfer across time, quantity, and single-use enforcement.

`Permit2` also introduces a `Witness` that can be incorporated into the signed authorization payload. This capability allows application layers built on `Permit2` to verify additional, highly detailed information provided by the witness. This witness data can enforce specific execution conditions, such as a stop-loss trigger or precise controls for any given scenario.

Conceptually, the witness data acts as the specific memo on a traditional check. When an application attempts to execute the transaction, it checks both the precise authorization controls and the execution conditions contained within the Witness data, ensuring the fund transfer and the contextual rules are fully validated.

## Security and Efficiency Advantages

Granular Control: Control is extremely fine-grained, covering the deadline, amount, spender, and unique nonce, and further enhanced by scenario-specific rules via the Witness data.

No Infinite Approvals: There is no reliance on indefinite approve spending limits, nor is blanket authorization required for a specific application. A signature is only valid for a single, one-time use intent and cannot be replayed or reused.

Gas Efficiency via Off-Chain Signing: The signing process is performed off-chain, minimizing interaction with the blockchain. This signed authorization can be delegated to any relayer for on-chain execution, resulting in significant gas savings for the user.

## How Lighter.IM Leverages Permit2 for Intent-Based Trading

**Bulk Selling (Delegated Intent)**: The Seller signs an authorization specifying a deadline, the total available amount, price, counterparty (Buyer) constraintsâ€”such as acceptable single purchase quantities, and payment method details. The Buyer can then execute multiple atomic purchases within the specified constraints until the total amount is consumed or the deadline expires.

**Single-Lot Selling (Atomic Intent)**: The Seller specifies conditions (deadline, amount range, price, payment method), but the signature is limited to a single, one-time execution.

**Taking Buyer Intent**: The Seller confirms and accepts the Buyer's existing intent, initiating the trade with a single signature authorization to transfer the committed funds.
